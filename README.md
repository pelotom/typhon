# Typhon
---

Typhon is a toy language that compiles to Java. The type inferencer is mostly a simplified version of the algorithm presented in [this paper](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/higher-rank/putting.pdf) (it does not currently support arbitrary-rank types!) The pattern matching algorithm comes from chapter 5 of [this book](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/).
