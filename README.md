This is a toy language mostly guided by [The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/) and [Practical Type Inference For Arbitrary-Rank Types](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/higher-rank/putting.pdf) (although it does not currently support arbitrary-rank types!)
